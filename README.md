# rota - An OTA server for the ESP8266 and ESP32 microcontrollers, written in Rust.

## Installation
**R**ust **OTA** can be installed by running

`git clone https://github.com/Evander12345/rota.git`

followed by
 
`cargo install --path=rota`

## Configuation
Currently the configuration is rather complicated... I am trying to streamline this process currently.
